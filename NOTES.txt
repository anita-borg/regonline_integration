merch = client.service.GetRegistrationsMerchandiseForEvent( eventID=1639610 )



TODO:

* For each code, the computed redeemed (count of registrants) and available (quantity - redeemed) in the fields 'redeemed' and 'available'

* Top level stats:
  * nonsponsored
  * redeemed 
  * reserved

Also, a breakdown by each major category:
  * Corporate
  * Academic
  * Lab & Non Profit
  * Show Management

Need a mapping of each registration type to breakdown category.

Probably need to add the breakdown category as an element of the
discount_code data structure (although it could be computed???)


0. Make the app key actually secret (e.g. load from file not in source
control).

0. Set up delay on email sending from mandrill.

This costs money: 5 cents for every thousand scheduled, plus 2 cents a
day for every thousand in storage.

To schedule a message, indicate when the message should be sent using the send_at parameter to the messages/send, messages/send-template, or messages/send-raw API calls. If you're using SMTP, you can provide the schedule time in the X-MC-SendAt header. Both SMTP and the API accept a UTC timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. The message ID returned by the send call can be used to cancel or reschedule the message.

3. Loggly config: new system.

   * Requires a new account, can't log to a different token without
     messing up VIBLIO stuff.

   * Set up more email alerts after we set up domain.
