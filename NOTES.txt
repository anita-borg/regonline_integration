TODO:

0. Make the app key actually secret (e.g. load from file not in source
control).

0. Set up delay on email sending from mandrill.

This costs money: 5 cents for every thousand scheduled, plus 2 cents a
day for every thousand in storage.

To schedule a message, indicate when the message should be sent using the send_at parameter to the messages/send, messages/send-template, or messages/send-raw API calls. If you're using SMTP, you can provide the schedule time in the X-MC-SendAt header. Both SMTP and the API accept a UTC timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. The message ID returned by the send call can be used to cancel or reschedule the message.

3. Loggly config: new system.

   * Requires a new account, can't log to a different token without
     messing up VIBLIO stuff.

   * Set up more email alerts after we set up domain.
